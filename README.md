# Acute-Lymphocytic-Leukemia-Disease-Detection-using-CNN

 The goal of this thesis is to develop a system for detecting acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) using images processing techniques and convolution neural network (CNN) classifier, thus automate the detection process. The proposed approach is assessed using ALL-IDB2. Additionally, broader use of the approach could offer an indication of the pre-leukemic condition and the residual sickness in the future.
